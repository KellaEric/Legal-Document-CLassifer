Contract Classification System Documentation 
Overview
An AI-powered solution for automated classification of legal contracts into five categories: NDAs, SLAs, Employment, Vendor, and Partnership agreements. The system combines classical machine learning with modern transformer models for accurate and scalable contract categorization.
Architecture
Core Components
â€¢	Data Processing Pipeline: Automated text cleaning and pre-processing
â€¢	Dual Model Architecture: 
o	TF-IDF + Logistic Regression (lightweight, fast inference)
o	BERT-based transformer (high accuracy for complex cases)
o	SVM
o	Linear Regression
o	Logistic Regression 
â€¢	REST API: Flask-based web service for real-time classification
â€¢	Evaluation Framework: Comprehensive performance metrics and analy-sis
Technical Stack
â€¢	Classical ML: TF-IDF vectorization with Logistic Regression
â€¢	Deep Learning: BERT-base-uncased with fine-tuning
â€¢	API: Flask RESTful service

Workflow
1. Data Preparation (uploaded_dataset.ipynb)
â€¢	Load and clean contract datasets (CSV, PDF, text)
â€¢	Text preprocessing (lowercasing, punctuation removal, tokenization)
â€¢	80/20 train-test split with stratified sampling
â€¢	Output: train.csv and test.csv
2. Model Training (classification_end_to_end.ipynb)
â€¢	TF-IDF Model: LinearSVC with n-gram features (1,2)
â€¢	BERT Model: Fine-tuned transformer with classification head
â€¢	Comprehensive evaluation with accuracy, F1-scores, confusion matrices

Performance Highlights
â€¢	NDAs: Highest classification accuracy due to distinctive terminology
â€¢	BERT Models: Superior performance on nuanced legal language
â€¢	TF-IDF Models: Fast inference (~10ms) for high-throughput scenarios
â€¢	Balanced Classes: Stratified sampling prevents classification bias
Installation & Usage
Setup
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run preprocessing
jupyter notebook uploaded_dataset.ipynb

# Train models  
jupyter notebook classification_end_to_end.ipynb

# Launch web app
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
Usage
1.	Upload contract document or paste text
2.	Select model (TF-IDF for speed, BERT for accuracy)
3.	View classification results and confidence scores
Limitations & Future Work
â€¢	Hardware Constraints: Limited GPU resources for large-scale BERT train-ing
â€¢	Inability to deploy models on an interactive web based for easy inter-action
â€¢	Planned Features: OCR for scanned PDFs, explain ability tools (LIME/SHAP), batch processing
â€¢	Scalability: Future cloud deployment with GPU acceleration
â€¢	Docker platform.
Technical Challenges Addressed
â€¢	Class Imbalance: Stratified sampling and class weight optimization
â€¢	Semantic Overlap: BERT's contextual understanding for similar contract clauses
â€¢	Speed Optimization: Model selection based on use case requirements
This system provides a robust foundation for automating contract management processes with intelligent classification capabilities.
